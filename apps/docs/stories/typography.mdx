# Typography

## Typefaces

Adjust’s products are translated into many different languages which also use different character sets (e.g., Chinese). To put a reliable, scalable, and performant solution in place, all text is rendered in system fonts. These are fonts that come with the operating system, meaning users do not need to download them.

### Typefaces

- Atlas uses **San Francisco** on Apple devices and **Arial** on all other systems (Windows, Linux, Android, …).

## Typographic Scale

The typographic scale is limited to five font sizes (including line height and letter spacing) in three weights. It works well on both small and large screens.

- Always use the scale; do not introduce other font sizes.

### Font Scale

- Regular copy is always set in normal font weight.
- Buttons and other controls use medium weight.
- Certain headings are set in bold.
- Most text (in LTR languages) should be left-aligned; use centered or even right-aligned text very sparingly!

The font sizes are multiples of 2px. The line heights are all multiples of 4px, creating a fine-grained 4px typographic baseline grid. If you wish to learn more, take a look at Atlas’ spacing system.
