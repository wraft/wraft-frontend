# Welcome to Wraft Design System 👋🏼

A design system that helps designers and developers to improve the user experience of Adjust’s growing product suite

## Practical, adaptable and functional

With products as big as ours, we need a system that will cover a lot of needs and be able to work as we scale. Adaptability is an important part of our design system, to make building and maintaining easier.

## Easy to understand, easy to use

Design systems have many different types of users, and cross-functional thinking is now a staple in modern teams. Our system is created collaboratively with this in mind, in order to help bridge the gap between design and development and speed up build.

Our core team aim while building this is twofold:

Peace of mind through fewer concerns for the whole Adjust team
Scale the product suite efficiently while keeping it consistent

## Benefits of a Design System
